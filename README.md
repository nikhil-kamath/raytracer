# raytracer
Fully functional raytracer implemented from scratch in OCaml

Create objects with transformations and a camera with a specific view, then render your image into an image file by calculating the lighting, shadows, and other effects at every pixel of the image!
All written from scratch in OCaml, following the book *The Ray Tracer Challenge* by Jamis Buck

Some examples using nested patterns, spheres, and planes:
